SongName;Now, Rainbow, my dear, I cannot express my delight;S2;E7
SongName;It's abundantly clear;S2;E7
SongName;That somewhere out here;S2;E7
SongName;Is the pet that will suit you just right;S2;E7
SongName;I can't wait to get started, but first let me set a few rules;S2;E7
SongName;It's of utmost importance;S2;E7
SongName;The pet that I get;S2;E7
SongName;Is something that's awesome and cool;S2;E7
SongName;I need something real fast like a bullet to keep up with me;S2;E7
SongName;Sure! How 'bout a bunny?;S2;E7
SongName;They're cutesy and wootsie and quick as can be;S2;E7
SongName;Cutesy? Wootsie? Have you even met me?;S2;E7
SongName;Rainbow, have faith;S2;E7
SongName;You see, I will bet you;S2;E7
SongName;Somewhere in here is the pet that will get you;S2;E7
SongName;I have so many wonderful choices for you to decide;S2;E7
SongName;There are otters and seals;S2;E7
SongName;With massive appeal;S2;E7
SongName;Wait! There must be a pet here;S2;E7
SongName;That will fit the ticket;S2;E7
SongName;How 'bout a ladybug, or a cute cricket?;S2;E7
SongName;I have plenty of wonderful creatures who soar in the sky;S2;E7
SongName;Like a sweet hummingbird or a giant monarch butterfly;S2;E7
SongName;I see. How 'bout an owl, or a wasp, or a toucan?;S2;E7
SongName;There's so many wonderful creatures the likes of that;S2;E7
SongName;There are falcons and eagles;S2;E7
SongName;They are both quite regal;S2;E7
SongName;Or perhaps what you need is a dark and mysterious bat?;S2;E7
SongName;The bat would be awesome, but the wasp I'm digging too;S2;E7
SongName;Do you have something in a yellow striped bat?;S2;E7
SongName;What to do, what to do? ;S2;E7
SongName;A prize! That's it! There's really just one way;S2;E7
SongName;To find out which animal's best;S2;E7
SongName;Hold a contest of speed, agility, and guts;S2;E7
SongName;That will put each pet to the test;S2;E7
SongName;Don't forget style, that should be considered;S2;E7
SongName;Then we'll know for sure who's best of the litter;S2;E7
SongName;The one who is awesomest cool;S2;E7
SongName;Just like me;S2;E7
SongName;Can't settle for less, 'cause I'm the best;S2;E7
SongName;Who's the number one, greatest, perfectest pet;S2;E7

SongName;Spreading seeds both far and wide;S4;E7

SongName;As we sing out across the land;S4;E9
SongName;We're Apples forever, Apples together;S4;E9

SongName;Because I fear I've got the croup;S4;E11
SongName;I need a vat of pumpkin soup;S4;E11
SongName;And scarves made out of zinnias;S4;E11
SongName;Did I say zinnias? I meant silk;S4;E11
SongName;Or something shiny of that ilk;S4;E11
SongName;And then I'll need some nice warm milk;S4;E11
SongName;And pastries from Abyssinia;S4;E11

SongName;Why not give my aching tummy;S4;E11

SongName;Don't have much time to gather all the things I need;S4;E12

SongName;I hope that when you hear the truth, you will not be aghast;S4;E12
SongName;I wasn't quite the super party pony like I claimed;S4;E12
SongName;The fact is that I was so shy, nopony knew my name;S4;E12
SongName;I stumbled into Ponyville one afternoon by chance;S4;E12
SongName;And found the biggest ever celebration party dance;S4;E12
SongName;Everything was perfect, cheer was filling up the place;S4;E12
SongName;And I saw that everypony had a smile upon their face;S4;E12
SongName;I vowed that day to change my life, the past I did set free;S4;E12
SongName;For now Cheese Sandwich was a party pony full of glee;S4;E12
SongName;A super duper party pony -- that's what I became;S4;E12
SongName;I traveled all Equestria, and all did know my name;S4;E12
SongName;But that never would have happened on my own, I'll tell you why;S4;E12
SongName;For the one who threw that party, it was you, Pinkie Pie;S4;E12
SongName;Super duper party ponies -- that is me and you;S4;E12

SongName;These new gems add such flair;S5;E14
SongName;Their beauty can't compare;S5;E14
SongName;This old style suddenly gleams anew;S5;E14
SongName;The rules of Rarity;S5;E14
SongName;Once stood for something;S5;E14
SongName;But now it feels just like some factory;S5;E14
SongName;Now every dress I make;S5;E14
SongName;With every flaw and mistake;S5;E14
SongName;Oh, how it makes my heart;S5;E14
SongName;My heart just break;S5;E14
SongName;My favorite moment's when a pony sees it;S5;E14
SongName;That special gown that she just adores;S5;E14
SongName;That pony's now in style;S5;E14
SongName;My hard work's all worthwhile;S5;E14
SongName;Oh, yes, it makes my heart;S5;E14
SongName;My heart just soar!;S5;E14
SongName;Sisterhood;S5;E17

SongName;Sisterhood;S5;E17
SongName;Is a bond that never ends;S5;E17
SongName;Sisterhood;S5;E17

SongName;We've been searchin' for our cutie marks;S5;E18
SongName;For a while now;S5;E18
SongName;Tryin' to find out how we fit in;S5;E18
SongName;So many ways we've tried before;S5;E18
SongName;But we keep on tryin' more;S5;E18
SongName;'Cause the Cutie Mark Crusaders don't give in;S5;E18
SongName;We'll make our mark;S5;E18

SongName;'Cause when we vote together;S5;E18
SongName;There's nothing that we can't achieve;S5;E18
SongName;I don't believe what I am hearing;S5;E18
SongName;I'm the only one you should be cheering;S5;E18
SongName;Pipsqueak? Try "Pip's weak!" Don't you think?;S5;E18
SongName;But a diamond is perfection;S5;E18
SongName;It's natural selection;S5;E18
SongName;So your vote better be for me, not the weakest link;S5;E18
SongName;Everypony has their little secrets;S5;E18
SongName;A vote for me will help you keep them safe;S5;E18
SongName;Like your creepy super strength!;S5;E18
SongName;Or your mane extension;S5;E18
SongName;A little thing I won't mention;S5;E18
SongName;Or those freakish large teeth in your face!;S5;E18
SongName;You've gotta vote for change;S5;E18

SongName;Vote for Pip!;S5;E18
SongName;It's finally time we beat her;S5;E18

SongName;'Cause when we vote together;S5;E18
SongName;There's nothing that we can't achieve;S5;E18
SongName;Vote for Pip!;S5;E18
SongName;If I'm a diamond;S5;E18
SongName;Then why do I feel so rough?;S5;E18
SongName;I'm as strong as a stone;S5;E18
SongName;Even that's not enough;S5;E18
SongName;There's something jagged in me;S5;E18
SongName;And I've made such mistakes;S5;E18
SongName;I thought that diamonds were hard;S5;E18
SongName;Though I feel I could break;S5;E18
SongName;Would you believe;S5;E18
SongName;That I've always wished I could be somepony else?;S5;E18
SongName;Yet I can't see;S5;E18
SongName;What I need to do to be the pony I want to be;S5;E18
SongName;I've been told my whole life;S5;E18
SongName;What to do, what to say;S5;E18
SongName;Nopony showed me that;S5;E18
SongName;There might be some better way;S5;E18
SongName;And now I feel like I'm lost;S5;E18
SongName;I don't know what to do;S5;E18
SongName;The ground is sinking away;S5;E18
SongName;I'm about to fall through;S5;E18
SongName;Would you believe;S5;E18
SongName;That I've always wished I could be somepony else?;S5;E18
SongName;Yet I can't see;S5;E18
SongName;What I need to do to be the pony I want to be;S5;E18
SongName;To be the pony I want to be;S5;E18
SongName;Cutie Mark Crusaders, get out of my way;S5;E18
SongName;Those ponies need to know the truth;S5;E18
SongName;And they'll hear it from me;S5;E18
SongName;Stop! Diamond Tiara, this is not the way;S5;E18
SongName;You know you're better than this hostility;S5;E18
SongName;You don't even know me at all;S5;E18
SongName;Don't understand the meaning of my fall;S5;E18
SongName;What my family would think if I ever;S5;E18
SongName;Fail at anything;S5;E18
SongName;I'm a diamond – that means you'll never break;S5;E18
SongName;No matter what be the cost of the path I take;S5;E18
SongName;Whatever I have to do to win in the end;S5;E18
SongName;Stop! This is not the answer;S5;E18
SongName;Wait! And it's plainly seen;S5;E18
SongName;Listen! You can redeem yourself;S5;E18
SongName;But by helping others, not by being mean;S5;E18
SongName;We know you want friends who admire you;S5;E18
SongName;You want to be the star with all the power too;S5;E18
SongName;But there's a better way, there's a better wa-a-ay;S5;E18
SongName;There's so much more still left to;S5;E18
SongName;Learn about yourself;S5;E18
SongName;See the light that shines in you;S5;E18
SongName;We know you can be somepony else;S5;E18
SongName;You can stop right now;S5;E18
SongName;And try another start;S5;E18

SongName;And see the light;S5;E18
SongName;And see the light of your cutie mark;S5;E18
SongName;We'll build a playground;S5;E18

SongName;'Cause now the future's bright for me;S5;E18
SongName;My cutie mark has set me free;S5;E18
SongName;To do what's right and be the pony I want to be;S5;E18
SongName;And be the pony I want to be!;S5;E18
SongName;We were searching for our cutie marks;S5;E18
SongName;For a while there;S5;E18
SongName;Trying to find out how we fit in;S5;E18
SongName;So many ways we've tried before;S5;E18
SongName;But we kept on trying more;S5;E18
SongName;'Cause the Cutie Mark Crusaders don't give in;S5;E18
SongName;Now we know what it took all along;S5;E18
SongName;And our journey here is never really done;S5;E18
SongName;For it is more than just a mark;S5;E18
SongName;It's a place for us to start;S5;E18

SongName;And now I feel my stars align;S5;E24
SongName;For I had believed what I was sold;S5;E24
SongName;I did all the things that I was told;S5;E24
SongName;But all that has changed, and now I'm bold;S5;E24
SongName;'Cause I know;S5;E24
SongName;That I am just a pony;S5;E24
SongName;I make mistakes from time to time;S5;E24
SongName;But now I know the real me;S5;E24

SongName;I never thought that I could just begin;S5;E26
SongName;Right where I left off and make a friend;S5;E26
SongName;Don't ever think that it might be too late;S5;E26
SongName;You don't have to wait, there's no mistakes with the friends you make;S5;E26

SongName;Because your friends are always there for you;S5;E26

SongName;And the door will be open;S8;E2
SongName;To all creatures great and small;S8;E2
SongName;And a yak or two or three;S8;E2
SongName;Sing in perfect harmony;S8;E2
SongName;That might have been a changeling;S8;E2
SongName;But it kind of looks like me;S8;E2
SongName;This school of friendship is for all of us;S8;E2
SongName;A place where we belong;S8;E2
SongName;Where we all learn to share and trust;S8;E2
SongName;The only rule here is to find your way;S8;E2
SongName;And friendship always wins at the end of the day;S8;E2
SongName;Some things you just can't teach with books;S8;E2
SongName;Some things you only know;S8;E2
SongName;So trust your heart and let us lead;S8;E2
SongName;And your friendship's sure to grow;S8;E2
SongName;And once we master kindness;S8;E2
SongName;We will spread it 'cross this land;S8;E2
SongName;And give the gift that's ours to share;S8;E2
SongName;So others understand;S8;E2
SongName;This school of friendship is for all of us;S8;E2
SongName;A place where we belong;S8;E2
SongName;Where we all learn to share and trust;S8;E2
SongName;The only rule here is to find your way;S8;E2
SongName;And friendship always wins at the end of the day!;S8;E2
SongName;Your heart is in two places, you can only live in one;S8;E6
SongName;You're torn between the hilltops and the tide;S8;E6
SongName;Thank goodness that the Cutie Mark Crusaders have begun;S8;E6
SongName;To give you hope and help you to decide;S8;E6
SongName;These hills, they call to you, they say "Harmonizing Heights";S8;E6
SongName;This is your home, simple and serene;S8;E6
SongName;The sun-dappled leaves or a mountain terrace;S8;E6
SongName;You can see twenty-three different shades of green;S8;E6
SongName;To dare to compare anywhere to there;S8;E6
SongName;Is unfair and just plain wrong;S8;E6
SongName;Colt or mare or you wear feathers, fins, or hair;S8;E6
SongName;This is where you belong;S8;E6
SongName;Build your nest here on Harmonizing Heights;S8;E6
SongName;Live it up here in Seaquestria;S8;E6
SongName;Nothing compares to Harmonizing Heights;S8;E6
SongName;The eagles are regal;S8;E6
SongName;But the schools are cooler;S8;E6
SongName;Their claws are so awesome;S8;E6
SongName;With their sweet maneuvers;S8;E6
SongName;Star wishes every night;S8;E6
SongName;Starfish by eel light;S8;E6
SongName;Better;S8;E6
SongName;Wetter;S8;E6
SongName;Shinier;S8;E6
SongName;Brinier;S8;E6
SongName;Seaquestria!;S8;E6
SongName;Harmonizing Heights!;S8;E6
SongName;Seaquestria!;S8;E6
SongName;Harmonizing Heights!;S8;E6
SongName;That's it! This is the end!;S8;E6
SongName;Don't ever talk to me again!;S8;E6
SongName;Ponies' voices fill the night;S8;E15
SongName;Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again;S8;E15
SongName;Come on, everycreature! Sing!;S8;E15
SongName;La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la;S8;E15
SongName;La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la;S8;E15
SongName; La-la-la-la... la...;S8;E15
SongName;Carols, carols, carols, carols, caroooools;S8;E15
SongName;Yak song! Yak song! Not very long! Sing again!;S8;E15
SongName;Yak song! Yak song! Not very long! Sing again!;S8;E15
SongName;Yak song! Yak song! Not very long! Sing again!;S8;E15
SongName;Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again!;S8;E15
SongName;If you're alone and you can't make friends;S8;E16
SongName;We understand your plight;S8;E16
SongName;Until now, there was just one way;S8;E16
SongName;Your friendships could take flight;S8;E16
SongName;There is a school real far away;S8;E16
SongName;That'll teach you what to know;S8;E16
SongName;But if you live here, you couldn't stay;S8;E16
SongName;You'd learn you have to go-o-o-o;S8;E16
SongName;Now, there is an alternative to all of that adversity;S8;E16
SongName;Not just a school, I'll have you know;S8;E16
SongName;But a whole university;S8;E16
SongName;At Friendship U, our aim is true;S8;E16
SongName;In a city, not some backwater;S8;E16
SongName;You'll learn the things you need to know;S8;E16
SongName;At our new alma mater;S8;E16
SongName;As you can see, we're a success;S8;E16
SongName;By any kind of stat;S8;E16
SongName;That may be so, for all I know;S8;E16
SongName;But I still smell a rat;S8;E16
SongName;Everypony, lookie here;S8;E16
SongName;That other school's headmare;S8;E16
SongName;Her presence is a testament;S8;E16
SongName;To the mutual respect...;S8;E16
SongName;...we sha-a-a-are;S8;E16
SongName;It really is the final piece;S8;E16
SongName;To make our work complete;S8;E16
SongName;To have the Friendship Princess;S8;E16
SongName;Bless our school is such a treat;S8;E16
SongName;At Friendship U, we teach to you ;S8;E16
SongName;All of our friendship knowledge;S8;E16
SongName;You'll learn it all in half the time;S8;E16
SongName;At the one and only friendship college;S8;E16
SongName;The lessons that we teach have been;S8;E16
SongName;Reviewed and checked and edited;S8;E16
SongName;Which might explain why our new school's;S8;E16
SongName;About to be accredited;S8;E16
SongName;At Friendship U, oh, yes, it's true;S8;E16
SongName;Even the Princess of Friendship agrees;S8;E16
SongName;The only place in Equestria;S8;E16
SongName;To give out friendship degrees;S8;E16
SongName;Yeah!;S8;E16
SongName;Friendship U!;S8;E16
SongName;Friendship U!;S8;E16
SongName;Friendship U!;S8;E16
SongName;Friendship U!;S8;E16
SongName;Friendship U!;S8;E16
SongName;Friendship U!;S8;E16
SongName;It's the only university of Friendship U!;S8;E16
SongName;Yeah!;S8;E16
SongName;We're off on the road to friendship;S8;E19
SongName;Our ride might be tiny and small;S8;E19
SongName;But road trips are a great way, we've been told, to get along;S8;E19
SongName;I'm glad we're sticking to it, we've already got a song;S8;E19
SongName;We're off on the road to friendship;S8;E19
SongName;Side by side, just like peas in a pod;S8;E19
SongName;Our bond of friendship is stronger than this tour's demands;S8;E19
SongName;We're so tight, we can't move around;S8;E19
SongName;I guess we're stuck together 'cause we're friendship bound;S8;E19
SongName;We're off on the road to friendship;S8;E19
SongName;We've each got the other to blame;S8;E19
SongName;Any trip can be exhausting if you make a fuss;S8;E19
SongName;But we get on so well that's there no way that could be us;S8;E19
SongName;We're off on the road to friendship;S8;E19
SongName;And there's nowhere that we'd rather be;S8;E19
SongName;In summer, winter, spring, and fall, we're friends throughout the year;S8;E19
SongName;For untold seasons yet to come, our friendship will be here;S8;E19
SongName;We're so tight, we can't move around;S8;E19
SongName;We're friendship boooooound;S8;E19
SongName;We're friendship boooooound!;S8;E19
SongName;La, la-la-la, la-la;S8;E23
SongName;La-la-la, la-la-la;S8;E23
SongName;The Kirin used to speak and sing;S8;E23
SongName;We weren't always quiet;S8;E23
SongName;We told stories and funny jokes;S8;E23
SongName;My stand-up was a riot;S8;E23
SongName;But then one day, a fight broke out;S8;E23
SongName;And hurtful words were said;S8;E23
SongName;Flaring tempers were inflamed;S8;E23
SongName;Destruction quickly spread;S8;E23
SongName;And flaming bred from head to head;S8;E23
SongName;It even burnt our... bread;S8;E23
SongName;Sorry, I forgot how much I love rhyming. Where was I? Oh, right!;S8;E23
SongName;My happy village lay in ruins;S8;E23
SongName;Relationships got worse;S8;E23
SongName;Spoiler alert: we quickly learned;S8;E23
SongName;That words could be a curse;S8;E23
SongName;"No more talking," yelled our leader;S8;E23
SongName;The last thing said aloud;S8;E23
SongName;Into the Stream of Silence;S8;E23
SongName;We stepped as a crowd;S8;E23
SongName;The water cooled emotions;S8;E23
SongName;And peace was soon restored;S8;E23
SongName;But with no way to speak my thoughts;S8;E23
SongName;I got super... bored;S8;E23
SongName;Seriously, there's only so long that Sudoku can keep you entertained!;S8;E23
SongName;'Cause rainbows won't light up the sky;S8;E23
SongName;Unless you let it rain;S8;E23
SongName;And shiny apples sometimes come with worms;S8;E23
SongName;No, you can't give up your laughter;S8;E23
SongName;'Cause you're scared of a little pain;S8;E23
SongName;It's a lesson that the Kirin never learned;S8;E23
SongName;I was stuck in silent prison;S8;E23
SongName;With the voices in my head;S8;E23
SongName;'Til I tripped over my salvation;S8;E23
SongName;In a helpful flowerbed;S8;E23
SongName;I found a cure to clear my pipes;S8;E23
SongName;And I became quite chatty;S8;E23
SongName;With years and years of stored-up words;S8;E23
SongName;I drove my village batty;S8;E23
SongName;They didn't like my jokes and songs;S8;E23
SongName;And daily dose of news;S8;E23
SongName;The plays I wrote, the speeches spoke;S8;E23
SongName;Variety revues;S8;E23
SongName;Or the story about the Kirin who hid below an opera stage;S8;E23
SongName;And fell in love with this opera singer, and he wore a freaky half-mask thing, and he played the organ a lot and got all broody 'cause the singer was in love with another dude, so he took her away on this underground gondola. I mean, who doesn't love musical theater?!;S8;E23
SongName;The village leader made it clear;S8;E23
SongName;I had to make my choice;S8;E23
SongName;I could stay and live with them;S8;E23
SongName;Or I could keep my voice;S8;E23
SongName;So I came here, but left the couch alone;S8;E23
SongName;They're hard to move;S8;E23
SongName;With just the view for company;S8;E23
SongName;Until ya heard me groove;S8;E23
SongName;Take it away, boys!;S8;E23
SongName;'Cause rainbows won't light up the sky;S8;E23
SongName;Unless you let it rain;S8;E23
SongName;And candles just won't glow until they're burned;S8;E23
SongName;No, you can't give up your laughter;S8;E23
SongName;'Cause you're scared of a little pain;S8;E23
SongName;It's a lesson that my village never learned;S8;E23
SongName;No matter how hard I schooled them;S8;E23
SongName;Fear of hurt is still what ruled them;S8;E23
SongName;Sometimes you gotta let it raaaaaaaain!;S8;E23
SongName;Yeah, sometimes you've gotta let it rain;S8;E23
SongName;'Cause rainbows won't light up the sky ;S8;E23
SongName;Unless you let it rain ;S8;E23
SongName;And candles just won't glow until they're burned ;S8;E23
SongName;No, you can't give up your laughter ;S8;E23
SongName;'Cause you're scared of a little pain ;S8;E23
SongName;It's a lesson that my village never learned;S8;E23
SongName;Oh, yes, 'cause rainbows won't light up the sky ;S8;E23
SongName;Unless you let it...;S8;E23
SongName;Raaaaaaaain!;S8;E23
SongName;You can't be a dragon here;S8;E24
SongName;Look at these books up on the wall;S8;E24
SongName;This treasure pile's not right, I fear;S8;E24
SongName;Trust me, I got you covered here. You see all this soft pony stuff you're surrounded with? This has got to be the first thing to go.;S8;E24
SongName;Nothin' 'bout this place says "dragon den", there's too much fluff;S8;E24
SongName;All these fancy robes, toss in a pile;S8;E24
SongName;Take those goblets, dishes, is that gold? Still not enough!;S8;E24
SongName;De-ponifying might just take a while;S8;E24
SongName;Sure, this place is grandiose;S8;E24
SongName;But to a dragon, it's just gross;S8;E24
SongName;Time we make the lot all disappear;S8;E24
SongName;Reality you need a dose;S8;E24
SongName;To all these ponies, you're too close;S8;E24
SongName;You just can't be a dragon here;S8;E24
SongName;Good job, my boy! But this is still just the beginning!;S8;E24
SongName;Each and every dragon has a swagger all his own;S8;E24
SongName;Watch and I'll show you what I mean;S8;E24
SongName;You can't move like this with so much stuff to weigh you down;S8;E24
SongName;A dragon always keeps it lean;S8;E24
SongName;Lose this! This! Ooh, this is nice!;S8;E24
SongName;Your life is soft, your scales are coiffed;S8;E24
SongName;These pillows, beds, and sheets are washed;S8;E24
SongName;A delight, but it's just not right what's underneath;S8;E24
SongName;Every dragon must be free;S8;E24
SongName;Look at you, then look at me;S8;E24
SongName;Since when do dragons brush their teeth?;S8;E24
SongName;Ha! Please!;S8;E24
SongName;Sure, this place is grandiose;S8;E24
SongName;But to a dragon, it's just gross;S8;E24
SongName;Time we make the lot all disappear;S8;E24
SongName;Just grab it all and give to me;S8;E24
SongName;After that, then you'll be free;S8;E24
SongName;You just can't be a dragon heeeeere!;S8;E24
SongName;We celebrate our friendship;S9;E3
SongName;We celebrate the tree;S9;E3
SongName;The memories inside us;S9;E3
SongName;We'll build for all to see;S9;E3
SongName;The tree brought us together;S9;E3
SongName;And even though it's gone;S9;E3
SongName;Our monument of friendship;S9;E3
SongName;Can make the gift live on;S9;E3
SongName;A piece from me, a piece from you;S9;E3
SongName;We'll use the tree and we'll make do;S9;E3
SongName;If things don't fit, there's lots of glue;S9;E3
SongName;Friends don't quit in the end;S9;E3
SongName;And together, we'll see this through;S9;E3
SongName;It's hard to say farewell;S9;E3
SongName;To something you hold dear;S9;E3
SongName;But goodbye isn't forever;S9;E3
SongName;As long as we are here;S9;E3
SongName;The tree is in our memory ;S9;E3
SongName;Its roots have grown deep in our hearts;S9;E3
SongName;Its branches raise our spirits, together we're all bound;S9;E3
SongName;Forever it stands, lost but now it's found;S9;E3
SongName;So lift a beam and build it strong;S9;E3
SongName;Work as a team, it won't take long;S9;E3
SongName;Hey, Silverstream, I think that's wrong;S9;E3
SongName;We'll live the dream and sing our song;S9;E3
SongName;And make the tree something all can see;S9;E3
SongName;In a place where we belong!;S9;E3
SongName;The more you know how things are done;S9;E7
SongName;The more confident you'll be;S9;E7
SongName;There's more to a dance than just having fun;S9;E7
SongName;And there's no better teacher than me;S9;E7
SongName;Rarity!;S9;E7
SongName;Right in!;S9;E7
SongName;No need to wait another day;S9;E7
SongName;To be part of our smart soiree;S9;E7
SongName;The perfect dress;S9;E7
SongName;A color all the rage, but still unique;S9;E7
SongName;Now loose the braids;S9;E7
SongName;Try a style more fantastique;S9;E7
SongName;Here's what we'll do:;S9;E7
SongName;A horn-icure and a de-frizz;S9;E7
SongName;We'll dry shampoo this;S9;E7
SongName;Whatever yak part this is;S9;E7
SongName;Too curly, too blue;S9;E7
SongName;Too retro, too new;S9;E7
SongName;Too Twilight, too furry;S9;E7
SongName;We'll find one, don't you worry;S9;E7
SongName;Choose what you want to be and be it;S9;E7
SongName;Picture you to see and see it;S9;E7
SongName;I'm the mare to guarantee it;S9;E7
SongName;You'll fit right in;S9;E7
SongName;My plan, my grand design;S9;E7
SongName;Your friends will thrill to find;S9;E7
SongName;A new you that's too divine;S9;E7
SongName;Yeah, you're gonna—;S9;E7
SongName;Yona gonna—;S9;E7
SongName;Fit right in;S9;E7
SongName;Right in;S9;E7
SongName;Listen to me when I say;S9;E7
SongName;Once you learn the pony way;S9;E7
SongName;You'll/I'll start to fit right in;S9;E7
SongName;Right in;S9;E7
SongName;Yak not waste another day;S9;E7
SongName;To be part of your pony...;S9;E7
SongName;Waaaaayyyyy;S9;E7
SongName;Yak not waste another day to;S9;E7
SongName;Fit... right... in!;S9;E7
SongName;You've mastered so many pony ways;S9;E7
SongName;And grown a lot in the past few days;S9;E7
SongName;You've shown a turn that has earned our praise;S9;E7
SongName;And now I fit right...;S9;E7
SongName;...in;S9;E7
SongName;You fit right in!;S9;E7
SongName;I think I know a way that we can grow;S9;E8
SongName;Time to try something new, something better;S9;E8
SongName;No more solo, trust is the way to go;S9;E8
SongName;And all we need to do is work together;S9;E8
SongName;It's time to try a better way to be bad;S9;E8
SongName;Do we really need a better way to be bad?;S9;E8
SongName;United as one;S9;E8
SongName;Teamwork? Please, what a fad;S9;E8
SongName;Combine all our strength, we'll go to any length;S9;E8
SongName;Once we have a better way to be bad;S9;E8
SongName;Let's go begin, this time we're gonna win;S9;E8
SongName; say;S9;E8
SongName;I know you're in, I think I see a grin;S9;E8
SongName;For all this pain and torture, I swear you'll pay;S9;E8
SongName;This time, we've got a better way to be bad;S9;E8
SongName;Sounds like a long shot, this "better way" to be bad;S9;E8
SongName;United as one, we'll make those ponies so sad;S9;E8
SongName;If we say "okay", would you just go away?;S9;E8
SongName;Once we have a better way to be bad;S9;E8
SongName;We want to break their friendship;S9;E8
SongName;We want to make them weak;S9;E8
SongName;You want revenge on Starlight;S9;E8
SongName;You want that huge physique;S9;E8
SongName;So let's increase our chances;S9;E8
SongName;By working as a team;S9;E8
SongName;To crush our enemies to dust;S9;E8
SongName;And laugh as they all scream!;S9;E8
SongName;I think I see a better way to be bad;S9;E8
SongName;Just put me in charge, make me queen, you'll be glad;S9;E8
SongName;No! Listen to me, I'm the best of us three;S9;E8
SongName;Then you'll see a better way to be bad;S9;E8
SongName;You shall do as I command, I will rule this triad!;S9;E8
SongName; song!;S9;E8
SongName;Sorry, not any longer!;S9;E8
SongName;A better way to be bad;S9;E8
SongName;Now you're making me mad;S9;E8
SongName;Won't the ponies be sad?;S9;E8
SongName;That would make me so glad;S9;E8
SongName;Now we've got a better way to be baaaaaad!;S9;E8
SongName;There's a lotta little things you gotta do in this world;S9;E13
SongName;There's a lotta little things you gotta try;S9;E13
SongName;Just a pack of punchy plunges other ponies all take;S9;E13
SongName;That have princess-pony-passed us right by;S9;E13
SongName;Nopony knows you like your little sister;S9;E13
SongName;Nopony is a better confidante;S9;E13
SongName;Nopony is truer than the one you are;S9;E13
SongName;Nopony else here I could want;S9;E13
SongName;You can't saunter on a sojourn hid behind castle walls;S9;E13
SongName;You can't throw a throne down on the beach;S9;E13
SongName;So we're gonna be absconding;S9;E13
SongName;To a little vagabonding;S9;E13
SongName;And this bucket list is gonna be a peach;S9;E13
SongName;Nopony knows you like your older sister;S9;E13
SongName;Nopony is a better confidante;S9;E13
SongName;Nopony is truer than the one you are;S9;E13
SongName;Nopony else here I could want;S9;E13
SongName;There's a lotta little things you gotta try in this world;S9;E13
SongName;There's a lotta little things you gotta see;S9;E13
SongName;But just reading by a river and resting our hooves;S9;E13
SongName;Would practically be perfect for me;S9;E13
SongName;Nopony knows you like your sister;S9;E13
SongName;Nopony is a better confidante;S9;E13
SongName;Nopony is truer than the one you are;S9;E13
SongName;Nopony else here I could want;S9;E13
SongName;You can't venture on adventures if you're taking a nap;S9;E13
SongName;You can't check things off your checklist while you sleep;S9;E13
SongName;So let's take another hill;S9;E13
SongName;Sometimes you can be a pill;S9;E13
SongName;And why's the way ahead always so steep?;S9;E13
SongName;There's a lotta little things you gotta do in this world;S9;E13
SongName;There's a lotta little things you ought to view;S9;E13
SongName;And our little lotta list may be a little bit long;S9;E13
SongName; And might take a lotta bother to do;S9;E13
SongName;But I'm sure it gets better later on;S9;E13
SongName;And after darkest night's a new dawn;S9;E13
SongName;It's my turn to do the choosing;S9;E13
SongName;After river rapid cruising;S9;E13
SongName;This adventure isn't too fun to be on;S9;E13
SongName;So you're saying it's a mix-up;S9;E14
SongName;Of the sounds that I just made;S9;E14
SongName;That coaxed the snicker from your throat;S9;E14
SongName;In a delicate cascade?;S9;E14
SongName;If I did it one more time;S9;E14
SongName;If I reproduced that feat;S9;E14
SongName;Mixed up some letters here and there;S9;E14
SongName;You'd "lelly-baugh" tout suite?;S9;E14
SongName;Then that's all I need to do;S9;E14
SongName;That's who I need to be;S9;E14
SongName;I thought I needed laughter;S9;E14
SongName;But it has to come from me;S9;E14
SongName;Squirting flowers and knobby knees;S9;E14
SongName;Rubber chickens my expertise;S9;E14
SongName;If you want laughter, then stick with Cheese;S9;E14
SongName;I suppose now I should amp things up;S9;E14
SongName;To get the thing I'm after;S9;E14
SongName;Move whole syll-AB-les around;S9;E14
SongName;And change em-PHA-sis to get laughter ;S9;E14

SongName;'Cause being big is all it takes;S9;E22
SongName;Leaving behind the little pony you've known;S9;E22

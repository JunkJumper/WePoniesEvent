SongName;I start movin' when I'm feeling that groove, yeah;S7;E8
SongName;I've been writin' this song for you;S7;E8
SongName;Searchin' for the perfect rhyme;S7;E8
SongName;For the words I wanna say;S7;E8
SongName; Be mine;S7;E8
SongName; Every day I see you;S7;E8
SongName;I know you could be the one for me;S7;E8
SongName;Feel my heart a-beating like;S7;E8
SongName;The rain upon a bumblebee;S7;E8
SongName;Don't you see that I could, ah oh, ah oh;S7;E8
SongName;Whenever you are near me, I'm so... ah-oh;S7;E8
SongName;Sugar Belle!;S7;E8
SongName;Roses are red and violets are blue!;S7;E8
SongName;Sugar, Sugar!;S7;E8
SongName;My love is burning hot like a cheese fondue!;S7;E8
SongName;Sugar Belle!;S7;E8
SongName;Sugar Belle!;S7;E8
SongName;Sugar Belle!;S7;E8
SongName;Sugar Belle!;S7;E8
SongName;Sugar Belle!;S7;E8
SongName;Sugar Belle!;S7;E8
SongName;Sugar Belle!;S7;E8
SongName;We're far apart in every way;S7;E13
SongName;But you're the best part of my day;S7;E13
SongName;And sure as I breathe the air;S7;E13
SongName;I know we are the perfect pair;S7;E13
SongName;On a prickly path that goes on for miles;S7;E13
SongName;But it's worth it just to see you smile;S7;E13
SongName;And I cannot be pulled apart;S7;E13
SongName;From the hold you have on my heart;S7;E13
SongName;And even if the world tells us it's wrong;S7;E13
SongName;You're in my head like a catchy song;S7;E13
SongName;The seasons change and leaves may fall;S7;E13
SongName;But I'll be with you through them all;S7;E13
SongName;And rain or shine, you'll always be mine;S7;E13
SongName;On a prickly path that goes on for miles;S7;E13
SongName;You're the only one who makes it all worthwhile;S7;E13
SongName;And you should not blame me, too;S7;E13
SongName;If I can't help fallin' in love with you...;S7;E13
SongName;I never claimed to be perfect;S7;E14
SongName;My mistakes are all written in ink;S7;E14
SongName;None of us claimed to be perfect;S7;E14
SongName;And it's sad if that's what you all think;S7;E14
SongName;Our flaws helped to make us special;S7;E14
SongName;They bond us and keep us strong;S7;E14
SongName;Our flaws are what brought us together;S7;E14
SongName;So stop actin' like somethin's wrong;S7;E14
SongName;We're not flawless;S7;E14
SongName;We're a work in progress;S7;E14
SongName;We've got dents and we've got quirks;S7;E14
SongName;But it's our flaws that make us work;S7;E14
SongName;Yeah, we're not flawless;S7;E14
SongName;We're a work in progress;S7;E14
SongName;So tell me what flaws you got, too;S7;E14
SongName;'Cause I still like what's flawed about you;S7;E14
SongName;They say I'm a big shot;S7;E14
SongName;That my ego's the size of a whale;S7;E14
SongName;My confidence comes off as cocky;S7;E14
SongName;But it gives me the courage to fail;S7;E14
SongName;Sure, I can be a drama queen;S7;E14
SongName;A bit stuck-up, it's true;S7;E14
SongName;And I can be too eager to please;S7;E14
SongName;There's such thing as bein' too honest, too, 'cause;S7;E14
SongName;We're not flawless;S7;E14
SongName;We're a work in progress;S7;E14
SongName;We've got dents and we've got quirks;S7;E14
SongName;But it's our flaws that make us work;S7;E14
SongName;Yeah, we're not flawless;S7;E14
SongName;We're a work in progress;S7;E14
SongName;So tell me what flaws you got, too;S7;E14
SongName;'Cause I still like what's flawed about you;S7;E14
SongName;Ponies think I'm all bubbles and laughter;S7;E14
SongName;That I don't seem sincere;S7;E14
SongName;I might joke around a little too much;S7;E14
SongName;But I'm just so happy you're here;S7;E14
SongName;It took me a while to be confident;S7;E14
SongName;To really come out of my shell;S7;E14
SongName;But nopony has to be perfect;S7;E14
SongName;By now, don't you know us so well? Because, yeah;S7;E14
SongName;We're not flawless;S7;E14
SongName;We're a work in progress;S7;E14
SongName;We've got dents and we've got quirks;S7;E14
SongName;But it's our flaws that make us work;S7;E14
SongName;Yeah, we're not flawless;S7;E14
SongName;We're a work in progress;S7;E14
SongName;"Cutie marks are great," they say;S7;E21
SongName;Pfft, yeah, right!;S7;E21
SongName;They make you special in your way;S7;E21
SongName;But that special mark that's just for you;S7;E21
SongName;Will erase the stuff you liiiiiiike... to do;S7;E21
SongName;So you're good at charming snakes;S7;E21
SongName;Too bad!;S7;E21
SongName;Or you bake delicious cakes;S7;E21
SongName;Oh, well!;S7;E21
SongName;Maybe there are lots of things;S7;E21

SongName;Nopony to tell you who you have to be;S7;E21
SongName;Blank flanks are better;S7;E21
SongName;Keep your spirit soarin' free;S7;E21
SongName;So listen up 'cause I ain't lyin';S7;E21

SongName;Students galore, new ideas to explore;S8;E1
SongName;Can't contain the excitement I feel;S8;E1
SongName;Can't mess up, can't afford a mistake now;S8;E1
SongName;Think "success", keep it firmly in sight;S8;E1
SongName;Make sure to do things by the book;S8;E1
SongName;Make sure to do it all right;S8;E1
SongName;The School of Friendship, must get to class;S8;E1
SongName;Will we fail or will we pass?;S8;E1
SongName;Students learning from the best;S8;E1
SongName;Taking notes to pass the test;S8;E1
SongName;Wait, hold on! Not like that! Just a second!;S8;E1
SongName;I'm not sure if that method's approved;S8;E1
SongName;Let me take a look – yup, right here in the book;S8;E1
SongName;Come on! We just got in the groove!;S8;E1
SongName;Can't mess up, can't afford a mistake now;S8;E1
SongName;We are shaping young minds to ignite;S8;E1
SongName;Do it like it says in the book;S8;E1
SongName;Now make sure you're doing it right;S8;E1
SongName;There's not an equation on how to have fun;S8;E1
SongName;The students look bored now – oh, what have I done?;S8;E1
SongName;Can't teach bein' honest, not sure what to do;S8;E1
SongName;I'm quite certain I'm lost;S8;E1
SongName;None of us has a clue!;S8;E1
SongName;School of Friendship, another class;S8;E1
SongName;Wish it were more of a blast;S8;E1
SongName;Thought this school would be more fun;S8;E1
SongName;Can't wait for our classes to be done;S8;E1
SongName;School of Friendship;S8;E1
SongName;Can't mess up, can't afford a mistake now;S8;E1
SongName;No way to have fun;S8;E1
SongName;Oh, what have I done?;S8;E1
SongName;Bored with this class;S8;E1
SongName;Think "success", keep it firmly in sight;S8;E1
SongName;Wish that we could leave en masse!;S8;E1
SongName;We don't have a clue;S8;E1
SongName;Listen to this one request;S8;E1
SongName;Make things fun, we're really stressed;S8;E1
SongName;Make sure to do things by the book now;S8;E1
SongName;Can we tell her this thing is a mess?;S8;E1
SongName;This brand new school of friendship;S8;E2
SongName;Is home to everyone;S8;E2
SongName;We're learning how to trust;S8;E2
SongName;We're here to all have fun;S8;E2
SongName;With friendship ties that bind us;S8;E2
SongName;Tighter than the strongest bonds;S8;E2
SongName;We're hoof-in-hoof;S8;E2
SongName;In hand in hoof in wing or even claw;S8;E2
SongName;There's a griffon in the garden;S8;E2
SongName;Hippogriffs hang in the hall;S8;E2
SongName;And the door will be open;S8;E2
SongName;To all creatures great and small;S8;E2
SongName;And a yak or two or three;S8;E2
SongName;Sing in perfect harmony;S8;E2
SongName;That might have been a changeling;S8;E2
SongName;But it kind of looks like me;S8;E2
SongName;This school of friendship is for all of us;S8;E2
SongName;A place where we belong;S8;E2
SongName;Where we all learn to share and trust;S8;E2
SongName;The only rule here is to find your way;S8;E2
SongName;And friendship always wins at the end of the day;S8;E2
SongName;Some things you just can't teach with books;S8;E2
SongName;Some things you only know;S8;E2
SongName;So trust your heart and let us lead;S8;E2
SongName;And your friendship's sure to grow;S8;E2
SongName;And once we master kindness;S8;E2
SongName;We will spread it 'cross this land;S8;E2
SongName;And give the gift that's ours to share;S8;E2
SongName;So others understand;S8;E2
SongName;This school of friendship is for all of us;S8;E2
SongName;A place where we belong;S8;E2
SongName;Where we all learn to share and trust;S8;E2
SongName;The only rule here is to find your way;S8;E2
SongName;And friendship always wins at the end of the day!;S8;E2
SongName;Your heart is in two places, you can only live in one;S8;E6
SongName;You're torn between the hilltops and the tide;S8;E6
SongName;Thank goodness that the Cutie Mark Crusaders have begun;S8;E6
SongName;To give you hope and help you to decide;S8;E6
SongName;These hills, they call to you, they say "Harmonizing Heights";S8;E6
SongName;This is your home, simple and serene;S8;E6
SongName;The sun-dappled leaves or a mountain terrace;S8;E6
SongName;You can see twenty-three different shades of green;S8;E6
SongName;To dare to compare anywhere to there;S8;E6
SongName;Is unfair and just plain wrong;S8;E6
SongName;Colt or mare or you wear feathers, fins, or hair;S8;E6
SongName;This is where you belong;S8;E6
SongName;Build your nest here on Harmonizing Heights;S8;E6
SongName;Live it up here in Seaquestria;S8;E6
SongName;Nothing compares to Harmonizing Heights;S8;E6
SongName;The eagles are regal;S8;E6
SongName;But the schools are cooler;S8;E6
SongName;Their claws are so awesome;S8;E6
SongName;With their sweet maneuvers;S8;E6
SongName;Star wishes every night;S8;E6
SongName;Starfish by eel light;S8;E6
SongName;Better;S8;E6
SongName;Wetter;S8;E6
SongName;Shinier;S8;E6
SongName;Brinier;S8;E6
SongName;Seaquestria!;S8;E6
SongName;Harmonizing Heights!;S8;E6
SongName;Seaquestria!;S8;E6
SongName;Harmonizing Heights!;S8;E6
SongName;That's it! This is the end!;S8;E6
SongName;Don't ever talk to me again!;S8;E6
SongName;Ponies' voices fill the night;S8;E15
SongName;Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again;S8;E15
SongName;Come on, everycreature! Sing!;S8;E15
SongName;La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la;S8;E15
SongName;La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la;S8;E15
SongName; La-la-la-la... la...;S8;E15
SongName;Carols, carols, carols, carols, caroooools;S8;E15
SongName;Yak song! Yak song! Not very long! Sing again!;S8;E15
SongName;Yak song! Yak song! Not very long! Sing again!;S8;E15
SongName;Yak song! Yak song! Not very long! Sing again!;S8;E15
SongName;Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again!;S8;E15
SongName;If you're alone and you can't make friends;S8;E16
SongName;We understand your plight;S8;E16
SongName;Until now, there was just one way;S8;E16
SongName;Your friendships could take flight;S8;E16
SongName;There is a school real far away;S8;E16
SongName;That'll teach you what to know;S8;E16
SongName;But if you live here, you couldn't stay;S8;E16
SongName;You'd learn you have to go-o-o-o;S8;E16
SongName;Now, there is an alternative to all of that adversity;S8;E16
SongName;Not just a school, I'll have you know;S8;E16
SongName;But a whole university;S8;E16
SongName;At Friendship U, our aim is true;S8;E16
SongName;In a city, not some backwater;S8;E16
SongName;You'll learn the things you need to know;S8;E16
SongName;At our new alma mater;S8;E16
SongName;As you can see, we're a success;S8;E16
SongName;By any kind of stat;S8;E16
SongName;That may be so, for all I know;S8;E16
SongName;But I still smell a rat;S8;E16
SongName;Everypony, lookie here;S8;E16
SongName;That other school's headmare;S8;E16
SongName;Her presence is a testament;S8;E16
SongName;To the mutual respect...;S8;E16
SongName;...we sha-a-a-are;S8;E16
SongName;It really is the final piece;S8;E16
SongName;To make our work complete;S8;E16
SongName;To have the Friendship Princess;S8;E16
SongName;Bless our school is such a treat;S8;E16
SongName;At Friendship U, we teach to you ;S8;E16
SongName;All of our friendship knowledge;S8;E16
SongName;You'll learn it all in half the time;S8;E16
SongName;At the one and only friendship college;S8;E16
SongName;The lessons that we teach have been;S8;E16
SongName;Reviewed and checked and edited;S8;E16
SongName;Which might explain why our new school's;S8;E16
SongName;About to be accredited;S8;E16
SongName;At Friendship U, oh, yes, it's true;S8;E16
SongName;Even the Princess of Friendship agrees;S8;E16
SongName;The only place in Equestria;S8;E16
SongName;To give out friendship degrees;S8;E16
SongName;Yeah!;S8;E16
SongName;Friendship U!;S8;E16
SongName;Friendship U!;S8;E16
SongName;Friendship U!;S8;E16
SongName;Friendship U!;S8;E16
SongName;Friendship U!;S8;E16
SongName;Friendship U!;S8;E16
SongName;It's the only university of Friendship U!;S8;E16
SongName;Yeah!;S8;E16
SongName;We're off on the road to friendship;S8;E19
SongName;Our ride might be tiny and small;S8;E19
SongName;But road trips are a great way, we've been told, to get along;S8;E19
SongName;I'm glad we're sticking to it, we've already got a song;S8;E19
SongName;We're off on the road to friendship;S8;E19
SongName;Side by side, just like peas in a pod;S8;E19
SongName;Our bond of friendship is stronger than this tour's demands;S8;E19
SongName;We're so tight, we can't move around;S8;E19
SongName;I guess we're stuck together 'cause we're friendship bound;S8;E19
SongName;We're off on the road to friendship;S8;E19
SongName;We've each got the other to blame;S8;E19
SongName;Any trip can be exhausting if you make a fuss;S8;E19
SongName;But we get on so well that's there no way that could be us;S8;E19
SongName;We're off on the road to friendship;S8;E19
SongName;And there's nowhere that we'd rather be;S8;E19
SongName;In summer, winter, spring, and fall, we're friends throughout the year;S8;E19
SongName;For untold seasons yet to come, our friendship will be here;S8;E19
SongName;We're so tight, we can't move around;S8;E19
SongName;We're friendship boooooound;S8;E19
SongName;We're friendship boooooound!;S8;E19
SongName;La, la-la-la, la-la;S8;E23
SongName;La-la-la, la-la-la;S8;E23
SongName;The Kirin used to speak and sing;S8;E23
SongName;We weren't always quiet;S8;E23
SongName;We told stories and funny jokes;S8;E23
SongName;My stand-up was a riot;S8;E23
SongName;But then one day, a fight broke out;S8;E23
SongName;And hurtful words were said;S8;E23
SongName;Flaring tempers were inflamed;S8;E23
SongName;Destruction quickly spread;S8;E23
SongName;And flaming bred from head to head;S8;E23
SongName;It even burnt our... bread;S8;E23
SongName;Sorry, I forgot how much I love rhyming. Where was I? Oh, right!;S8;E23
SongName;My happy village lay in ruins;S8;E23
SongName;Relationships got worse;S8;E23
SongName;Spoiler alert: we quickly learned;S8;E23
SongName;That words could be a curse;S8;E23
SongName;"No more talking," yelled our leader;S8;E23
SongName;The last thing said aloud;S8;E23
SongName;Into the Stream of Silence;S8;E23
SongName;We stepped as a crowd;S8;E23
SongName;The water cooled emotions;S8;E23
SongName;And peace was soon restored;S8;E23
SongName;But with no way to speak my thoughts;S8;E23
SongName;I got super... bored;S8;E23
SongName;Seriously, there's only so long that Sudoku can keep you entertained!;S8;E23
SongName;'Cause rainbows won't light up the sky;S8;E23
SongName;Unless you let it rain;S8;E23
SongName;And shiny apples sometimes come with worms;S8;E23
SongName;No, you can't give up your laughter;S8;E23
SongName;'Cause you're scared of a little pain;S8;E23
SongName;It's a lesson that the Kirin never learned;S8;E23
SongName;I was stuck in silent prison;S8;E23
SongName;With the voices in my head;S8;E23
SongName;'Til I tripped over my salvation;S8;E23
SongName;In a helpful flowerbed;S8;E23
SongName;I found a cure to clear my pipes;S8;E23
SongName;And I became quite chatty;S8;E23
SongName;With years and years of stored-up words;S8;E23
SongName;I drove my village batty;S8;E23
SongName;They didn't like my jokes and songs;S8;E23
SongName;And daily dose of news;S8;E23
SongName;The plays I wrote, the speeches spoke;S8;E23
SongName;Variety revues;S8;E23
SongName;Or the story about the Kirin who hid below an opera stage;S8;E23
SongName;And fell in love with this opera singer, and he wore a freaky half-mask thing, and he played the organ a lot and got all broody 'cause the singer was in love with another dude, so he took her away on this underground gondola. I mean, who doesn't love musical theater?!;S8;E23
SongName;The village leader made it clear;S8;E23
SongName;I had to make my choice;S8;E23
SongName;I could stay and live with them;S8;E23
SongName;Or I could keep my voice;S8;E23
SongName;So I came here, but left the couch alone;S8;E23
SongName;They're hard to move;S8;E23
SongName;With just the view for company;S8;E23
SongName;Until ya heard me groove;S8;E23
SongName;Take it away, boys!;S8;E23
SongName;'Cause rainbows won't light up the sky;S8;E23
SongName;Unless you let it rain;S8;E23
SongName;And candles just won't glow until they're burned;S8;E23
SongName;No, you can't give up your laughter;S8;E23
SongName;'Cause you're scared of a little pain;S8;E23
SongName;It's a lesson that my village never learned;S8;E23
SongName;No matter how hard I schooled them;S8;E23
SongName;Fear of hurt is still what ruled them;S8;E23
SongName;Sometimes you gotta let it raaaaaaaain!;S8;E23
SongName;Yeah, sometimes you've gotta let it rain;S8;E23
SongName;'Cause rainbows won't light up the sky ;S8;E23
SongName;Unless you let it rain ;S8;E23
SongName;And candles just won't glow until they're burned ;S8;E23
SongName;No, you can't give up your laughter ;S8;E23
SongName;'Cause you're scared of a little pain ;S8;E23
SongName;It's a lesson that my village never learned;S8;E23
SongName;Oh, yes, 'cause rainbows won't light up the sky ;S8;E23
SongName;Unless you let it...;S8;E23
SongName;Raaaaaaaain!;S8;E23
SongName;You can't be a dragon here;S8;E24
SongName;Look at these books up on the wall;S8;E24
SongName;This treasure pile's not right, I fear;S8;E24
SongName;Trust me, I got you covered here. You see all this soft pony stuff you're surrounded with? This has got to be the first thing to go.;S8;E24
SongName;Nothin' 'bout this place says "dragon den", there's too much fluff;S8;E24
SongName;All these fancy robes, toss in a pile;S8;E24
SongName;Take those goblets, dishes, is that gold? Still not enough!;S8;E24
SongName;De-ponifying might just take a while;S8;E24
SongName;Sure, this place is grandiose;S8;E24
SongName;But to a dragon, it's just gross;S8;E24
SongName;Time we make the lot all disappear;S8;E24
SongName;Reality you need a dose;S8;E24
SongName;To all these ponies, you're too close;S8;E24
SongName;You just can't be a dragon here;S8;E24
SongName;Good job, my boy! But this is still just the beginning!;S8;E24
SongName;Each and every dragon has a swagger all his own;S8;E24
SongName;Watch and I'll show you what I mean;S8;E24
SongName;You can't move like this with so much stuff to weigh you down;S8;E24
SongName;A dragon always keeps it lean;S8;E24
SongName;Lose this! This! Ooh, this is nice!;S8;E24
SongName;Your life is soft, your scales are coiffed;S8;E24
SongName;These pillows, beds, and sheets are washed;S8;E24
SongName;A delight, but it's just not right what's underneath;S8;E24
SongName;Every dragon must be free;S8;E24
SongName;Look at you, then look at me;S8;E24
SongName;Since when do dragons brush their teeth?;S8;E24
SongName;Ha! Please!;S8;E24
SongName;Sure, this place is grandiose;S8;E24
SongName;But to a dragon, it's just gross;S8;E24
SongName;Time we make the lot all disappear;S8;E24
SongName;Just grab it all and give to me;S8;E24
SongName;After that, then you'll be free;S8;E24
SongName;You just can't be a dragon heeeeere!;S8;E24

SongName;Yak not waste another day;S9;E7
SongName;To be part of your pony...;S9;E7
SongName;Waaaaayyyyy;S9;E7
SongName;Yak not waste another day to;S9;E7
SongName;Fit... right... in!;S9;E7
SongName;You've mastered so many pony ways;S9;E7
SongName;And grown a lot in the past few days;S9;E7
SongName;You've shown a turn that has earned our praise;S9;E7
SongName;And now I fit right...;S9;E7
SongName;...in;S9;E7
SongName;You fit right in!;S9;E7
SongName;I think I know a way that we can grow;S9;E8
SongName;Time to try something new, something better;S9;E8
SongName;No more solo, trust is the way to go;S9;E8
SongName;And all we need to do is work together;S9;E8
SongName;It's time to try a better way to be bad;S9;E8
SongName;Do we really need a better way to be bad?;S9;E8
SongName;United as one;S9;E8
SongName;Teamwork? Please, what a fad;S9;E8
SongName;Combine all our strength, we'll go to any length;S9;E8
SongName;Once we have a better way to be bad;S9;E8
SongName;Let's go begin, this time we're gonna win;S9;E8
SongName; say;S9;E8
SongName;I know you're in, I think I see a grin;S9;E8
SongName;For all this pain and torture, I swear you'll pay;S9;E8
SongName;This time, we've got a better way to be bad;S9;E8
SongName;Sounds like a long shot, this "better way" to be bad;S9;E8
SongName;United as one, we'll make those ponies so sad;S9;E8
SongName;If we say "okay", would you just go away?;S9;E8
SongName;Once we have a better way to be bad;S9;E8
SongName;We want to break their friendship;S9;E8
SongName;We want to make them weak;S9;E8
SongName;You want revenge on Starlight;S9;E8
SongName;You want that huge physique;S9;E8
SongName;So let's increase our chances;S9;E8
SongName;By working as a team;S9;E8
SongName;To crush our enemies to dust;S9;E8
SongName;And laugh as they all scream!;S9;E8
SongName;I think I see a better way to be bad;S9;E8
SongName;Just put me in charge, make me queen, you'll be glad;S9;E8
SongName;No! Listen to me, I'm the best of us three;S9;E8
SongName;Then you'll see a better way to be bad;S9;E8
SongName;You shall do as I command, I will rule this triad!;S9;E8
SongName; song!;S9;E8
SongName;Sorry, not any longer!;S9;E8
SongName;A better way to be bad;S9;E8
SongName;Now you're making me mad;S9;E8
SongName;Won't the ponies be sad?;S9;E8
SongName;That would make me so glad;S9;E8
SongName;Now we've got a better way to be baaaaaad!;S9;E8
SongName;There's a lotta little things you gotta do in this world;S9;E13
SongName;There's a lotta little things you gotta try;S9;E13
SongName;Just a pack of punchy plunges other ponies all take;S9;E13
SongName;That have princess-pony-passed us right by;S9;E13
SongName;Nopony knows you like your little sister;S9;E13
SongName;Nopony is a better confidante;S9;E13
SongName;Nopony is truer than the one you are;S9;E13
SongName;Nopony else here I could want;S9;E13
SongName;You can't saunter on a sojourn hid behind castle walls;S9;E13
SongName;You can't throw a throne down on the beach;S9;E13
SongName;So we're gonna be absconding;S9;E13
SongName;To a little vagabonding;S9;E13
SongName;And this bucket list is gonna be a peach;S9;E13
SongName;Nopony knows you like your older sister;S9;E13
SongName;Nopony is a better confidante;S9;E13
SongName;Nopony is truer than the one you are;S9;E13
SongName;Nopony else here I could want;S9;E13
SongName;There's a lotta little things you gotta try in this world;S9;E13
SongName;There's a lotta little things you gotta see;S9;E13
SongName;But just reading by a river and resting our hooves;S9;E13
SongName;Would practically be perfect for me;S9;E13
SongName;Nopony knows you like your sister;S9;E13
SongName;Nopony is a better confidante;S9;E13
SongName;Nopony is truer than the one you are;S9;E13
SongName;Nopony else here I could want;S9;E13
SongName;You can't venture on adventures if you're taking a nap;S9;E13
SongName;You can't check things off your checklist while you sleep;S9;E13
SongName;So let's take another hill;S9;E13
SongName;Sometimes you can be a pill;S9;E13
SongName;And why's the way ahead always so steep?;S9;E13
SongName;There's a lotta little things you gotta do in this world;S9;E13
SongName;There's a lotta little things you ought to view;S9;E13
SongName;And our little lotta list may be a little bit long;S9;E13
SongName; And might take a lotta bother to do;S9;E13
SongName;But I'm sure it gets better later on;S9;E13
SongName;And after darkest night's a new dawn;S9;E13
SongName;It's my turn to do the choosing;S9;E13
SongName;After river rapid cruising;S9;E13
SongName;This adventure isn't too fun to be on;S9;E13
SongName;So you're saying it's a mix-up;S9;E14
SongName;Of the sounds that I just made;S9;E14
SongName;That coaxed the snicker from your throat;S9;E14
SongName;In a delicate cascade?;S9;E14
SongName;If I did it one more time;S9;E14
SongName;If I reproduced that feat;S9;E14
SongName;Mixed up some letters here and there;S9;E14
SongName;You'd "lelly-baugh" tout suite?;S9;E14
SongName;Then that's all I need to do;S9;E14
SongName;That's who I need to be;S9;E14
SongName;I thought I needed laughter;S9;E14
SongName;But it has to come from me;S9;E14
SongName;Squirting flowers and knobby knees;S9;E14
SongName;Rubber chickens my expertise;S9;E14
SongName;If you want laughter, then stick with Cheese;S9;E14
SongName;I suppose now I should amp things up;S9;E14
SongName;To get the thing I'm after;S9;E14
SongName;Move whole syll-AB-les around;S9;E14
SongName;And change em-PHA-sis to get laughter ;S9;E14
SongName;Can't stop now, I'm on a roll;S9;E14
SongName;I've almost got it back;S9;E14
SongName;Bright folks like you aren't subject to;S9;E14
SongName;My play-on-words attack!;S9;E14
SongName;With something else, I'll have to play;S9;E14
SongName;To get me where I'm going;S9;E14
SongName;To get the laughter flowing;S9;E14
SongName;And it's what I need to do;S9;E14
SongName;It's who I need to be;S9;E14
SongName;I thought I needed laughter;S9;E14
SongName;But it has to come from me;S9;E14
SongName;Follow right behind, if you please;S9;E14
SongName;Walk this way and I guarantee;S9;E14
SongName;If you want laughter, then stick with Cheese;S9;E14
SongName;Accordion solo!;S9;E14
SongName;And now my biggest test;S9;E14
SongName;The hardest fish to fry;S9;E14
SongName;Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh;S9;E14
SongName;A mind so analytical;S9;E14
SongName;A sense of humor dry ;S9;E14
SongName;So dry!;S9;E14
SongName;To make you laugh would prove to me;S9;E14
SongName;That this experiment's done;S9;E14
SongName;Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh;S9;E14
SongName;Something ridiculous and not too smart;S9;E14
SongName;Something like a pun;S9;E14
SongName;Hey, Sans! How did the laughing bird's eggs hatch? They cracked up!;S9;E14
SongName;Then that's all I need to do;S9;E14
SongName;That's all I need to see;S9;E14
SongName;I thought I needed laughter;S9;E14
SongName;But it had to come from me;S9;E14
SongName;Squirting flowers and knobby knees;S9;E14
SongName;Rubber chickens and Dungarees;S9;E14
SongName;If you want laughter, then stick with Cheese!;S9;E14
SongName; We wanna dance for each other and for all of our friends!;S9;E15
SongName;Over... and over... and over again!;S9;E15
SongName;We wanna dance for each other and for all of our friends!;S9;E15
SongName; School of Friendship, rah, rah, rah;S9;E15
SongName;Let's win this game and hit the... oh, what rhymes with "rah"? Spa?;S9;E15
SongName;Over and over and over again!;S9;E15
SongName;We'll cheer for our team 'til the ve-ry end!;S9;E15
SongName;Everypony in the crowd, if you're feeling hip;S9;E15
SongName;When I say "friend-", you say "-ship"!;S9;E15
SongName;Friend!;S9;E15
SongName;Ship!;S9;E15
SongName;Friend!;S9;E15
SongName;Ship!;S9;E15
SongName;Welcome, everypony, to the halftime show;S9;E15
SongName;We're the friendship squad, and we're ready to go!;S9;E15
SongName;We're here to cheer and get you all excited;S9;E15
SongName;If you'd like to join in, then you're all invited!;S9;E15
SongName;It's a simple cheer, so don't chime in late;S9;E15
SongName;It goes two, four, six, GREAT!;S9;E15
SongName;Woke up this morning feeling tired and small;S9;E22
SongName;But look at us now - we must be ninety feet tall;S9;E22
SongName;Don't have to worry 'bout making mistakes;S9;E22
SongName;Because being big is all it takes;S9;E22
SongName;A tiny twist of fate brought on this big change;S9;E22
SongName;Give me room, gotta zoom, I've got plans to arrange;S9;E22
SongName;Can do what I want, be it run, trot, or traipse;S9;E22
SongName;'Cause being big is all it takes;S9;E22
SongName;Being big isn't just a size;S9;E22
SongName;At bedtime we don't even have to close our eyes;S9;E22
SongName;We're in control now, for goodness' sake;S9;E22
SongName;'Cause being big is all it takes;S9;E22
SongName;Leaving behind the little pony you've known;S9;E22
SongName;Stepping out, growing up, making moves of my own;S9;E22
SongName;You can't tell me no, there's no place I can't go;S9;E22
SongName;Mountains, cities, jungles, or lakes;S9;E22
SongName;'Cause being big is all it takes;S9;E22
SongName;Being big isn't just a size;S9;E22
SongName;We'll tell you our opinion 'cause we're oh, so wise;S9;E22
SongName;We're in control now, for goodness' sake;S9;E22
SongName;'Cause being big is all it takes;S9;E22
SongName;I can eat all the snacks 'cause that's for me to decide;S9;E22
SongName;We know how it all works, even what we ain't tried;S9;E22
SongName;Facts don't matter now 'cause it's not what we know;S9;E22
SongName;We can win any argument with...;S9;E22
SongName;"Because I say so!";S9;E22
SongName;Can't stop us now, don't try to stand in our way;S9;E22
SongName;We're awake, gonna take all we can from today;S9;E22
SongName;Once we had to listen, now you'll hear what we say;S9;E22
SongName;Everything is always okay;S9;E22
SongName;'Cause being big is all it taaaaaakes;S9;E22
SongName;All it takes!;S9;E22
SongName;When I started out, I was unsure;S9;E26
SongName;I thought I knew all that I needed, didn't know what to expect;S9;E26
SongName;But when my walls came down, I saw the truth;S9;E26
SongName;All along something was missing;S9;E26
SongName;And I think you'll see it, too;S9;E26
SongName;This is where the magic happens;S9;E26
SongName;This is where the magic lives;S9;E26
SongName;Our friendships weave together stronger;S9;E26
SongName;The bonds grow deeper, lasting longer;S9;E26
SongName;And the greatest spell you'll know;S9;E26
SongName;Is how the Magic of Friendship grows;S9;E26
SongName;And no matter how much time goes by;S9;E26
SongName;The party will still be here with some fun new games to try;S9;E26
SongName;Big adventure's waiting obviously;S9;E26
SongName;Long as we're still here together;S9;E26
SongName;We'll be flying happily;S9;E26
SongName;This is where the magic happens ;S9;E26
SongName;This is where the magic lives ;S9;E26
SongName;Our friendships weave together stronger;S9;E26
SongName;The bonds grow deeper, lasting longer;S9;E26
SongName;And the greatest spell there is;S9;E26
SongName;What the Magic of Friendship gives;S9;E26
SongName;And it's somethin' true to pass on down;S9;E26
SongName;To generations yet to come;S9;E26
SongName;And we'll never stop believing in;S9;E26
SongName;The generosity of the friendships we've won;S9;E26
SongName;And because the love that I feel;S9;E26
SongName;For every single living creature is something that is real;S9;E26
SongName;Friendship happens so naturally;S9;E26
SongName;Oh, and how I used to wonder;S9;E26
SongName;What friendship could be!;S9;E26
SongName;This is where the magic happens ;S9;E26
SongName;This is where the magic lives ;S9;E26
SongName;Our friendships weave together stronger;S9;E26

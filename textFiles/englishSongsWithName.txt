A Kirin Tale;"No more talking," yelled our leader;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;The last thing said aloud;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;Into the Stream of Silence;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;We stepped as a crowd;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;The water cooled emotions;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;And peace was soon restored;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;But with no way to speak my thoughts;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;I got super... bored;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;Seriously, there's only so long that Sudoku can keep you entertained!;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;'Cause rainbows won't light up the sky;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;Unless you let it rain;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;And shiny apples sometimes come with worms;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;No, you can't give up your laughter;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;'Cause you're scared of a little pain;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;It's a lesson that the Kirin never learned;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;I was stuck in silent prison;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;With the voices in my head;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;'Til I tripped over my salvation;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;In a helpful flowerbed;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;I found a cure to clear my pipes;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;And I became quite chatty;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;With years and years of stored-up words;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;I drove my village batty;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;They didn't like my jokes and songs;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;And daily dose of news;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;The plays I wrote, the speeches spoke;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;Variety revues;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;Or the story about the Kirin who hid below an opera stage;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;And fell in love with this opera singer, and he wore a freaky half-mask thing, and he played the organ a lot and got all broody 'cause the singer was in love with another dude, so he took her away on this underground gondola. I mean, who doesn't love musical theater?!;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;The village leader made it clear;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;I had to make my choice;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;I could stay and live with them;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;Or I could keep my voice;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;So I came here, but left the couch alone;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;They're hard to move;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;With just the view for company;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;Until ya heard me groove;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;Take it away, boys!;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;'Cause rainbows won't light up the sky;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;Unless you let it rain;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;And candles just won't glow until they're burned;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;No, you can't give up your laughter;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;'Cause you're scared of a little pain;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;It's a lesson that my village never learned;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;No matter how hard I schooled them;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;Fear of hurt is still what ruled them;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;Sometimes you gotta let it raaaaaaaain!;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;Yeah, sometimes you've gotta let it rain;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;'Cause rainbows won't light up the sky ;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;Unless you let it rain ;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;And candles just won't glow until they're burned ;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;No, you can't give up your laughter ;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;'Cause you're scared of a little pain ;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;It's a lesson that my village never learned;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;Oh, yes, 'cause rainbows won't light up the sky ;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;Unless you let it...;S8;E23
A Kirin Tale;Raaaaaaaain!;S8;E23
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;You can't be a dragon here;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;Look at these books up on the wall;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;This treasure pile's not right, I fear;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;Trust me, I got you covered here. You see all this soft pony stuff you're surrounded with? This has got to be the first thing to go.;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;Nothin' 'bout this place says "dragon den", there's too much fluff;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;All these fancy robes, toss in a pile;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;Take those goblets, dishes, is that gold? Still not enough!;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;De-ponifying might just take a while;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;Sure, this place is grandiose;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;But to a dragon, it's just gross;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;Time we make the lot all disappear;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;Reality you need a dose;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;To all these ponies, you're too close;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;You just can't be a dragon here;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;Good job, my boy! But this is still just the beginning!;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;Each and every dragon has a swagger all his own;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;Watch and I'll show you what I mean;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;You can't move like this with so much stuff to weigh you down;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;A dragon always keeps it lean;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;Lose this! This! Ooh, this is nice!;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;Your life is soft, your scales are coiffed;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;These pillows, beds, and sheets are washed;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;A delight, but it's just not right what's underneath;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;Every dragon must be free;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;Look at you, then look at me;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;Since when do dragons brush their teeth?;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;Ha! Please!;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;Sure, this place is grandiose;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;But to a dragon, it's just gross;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;Time we make the lot all disappear;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;Just grab it all and give to me;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;After that, then you'll be free;S8;E24
Just Can't Be a Dragon Here;You just can't be a dragon heeeeere!;S8;E24

Lotta Little Things;Just a pack of punchy plunges other ponies all take;S9;E13
Lotta Little Things;That have princess-pony-passed us right by;S9;E13
Lotta Little Things;Nopony knows you like your little sister;S9;E13
Lotta Little Things;Nopony is a better confidante;S9;E13
Lotta Little Things;Nopony is truer than the one you are;S9;E13
Lotta Little Things;Nopony else here I could want;S9;E13
Lotta Little Things;You can't saunter on a sojourn hid behind castle walls;S9;E13
Lotta Little Things;You can't throw a throne down on the beach;S9;E13
Lotta Little Things;So we're gonna be absconding;S9;E13
Lotta Little Things;To a little vagabonding;S9;E13
Lotta Little Things;And this bucket list is gonna be a peach;S9;E13
Lotta Little Things;Nopony knows you like your older sister;S9;E13

Lotta Little Things;Nopony is a better confidante;S9;E13
Lotta Little Things;Nopony is truer than the one you are;S9;E13
Lotta Little Things;Nopony else here I could want;S9;E13
Lotta Little Things;You can't venture on adventures if you're taking a nap;S9;E13
Lotta Little Things;You can't check things off your checklist while you sleep;S9;E13
Lotta Little Things;So let's take another hill;S9;E13
Lotta Little Things;Sometimes you can be a pill;S9;E13
Lotta Little Things;And why's the way ahead always so steep?;S9;E13
Lotta Little Things;There's a lotta little things you gotta do in this world;S9;E13
Lotta Little Things;There's a lotta little things you ought to view;S9;E13
Lotta Little Things;And our little lotta list may be a little bit long;S9;E13
Lotta Little Things; And might take a lotta bother to do;S9;E13
Lotta Little Things;But I'm sure it gets better later on;S9;E13

Lotta Little Things;It's my turn to do the choosing;S9;E13
Lotta Little Things;After river rapid cruising;S9;E13
Lotta Little Things;This adventure isn't too fun to be on;S9;E13
The Last Laugh;So you're saying it's a mix-up;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;Of the sounds that I just made;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;That coaxed the snicker from your throat;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;In a delicate cascade?;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;If I did it one more time;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;If I reproduced that feat;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;Mixed up some letters here and there;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;You'd "lelly-baugh" tout suite?;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;Then that's all I need to do;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;That's who I need to be;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;I thought I needed laughter;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;But it has to come from me;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;Squirting flowers and knobby knees;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;Rubber chickens my expertise;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;If you want laughter, then stick with Cheese;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;I suppose now I should amp things up;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;To get the thing I'm after;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;Move whole syll-AB-les around;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;And change em-PHA-sis to get laughter ;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;Can't stop now, I'm on a roll;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;I've almost got it back;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;Bright folks like you aren't subject to;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;My play-on-words attack!;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;With something else, I'll have to play;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;To get me where I'm going;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;To get the laughter flowing;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;And it's what I need to do;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;It's who I need to be;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;I thought I needed laughter;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;But it has to come from me;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;Follow right behind, if you please;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;Walk this way and I guarantee;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;If you want laughter, then stick with Cheese;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;Accordion solo!;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;And now my biggest test;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;The hardest fish to fry;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;A mind so analytical;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;A sense of humor dry ;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;So dry!;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;To make you laugh would prove to me;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;That this experiment's done;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;Something ridiculous and not too smart;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;Something like a pun;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;Hey, Sans! How did the laughing bird's eggs hatch? They cracked up!;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;Then that's all I need to do;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;That's all I need to see;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;I thought I needed laughter;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;But it had to come from me;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;Squirting flowers and knobby knees;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;Rubber chickens and Dungarees;S9;E14
The Last Laugh;If you want laughter, then stick with Cheese!;S9;E14

ACADECA;Can she do it? Who will take it?;S12;E4
ACADECA;Did she win it? Did she make it?;S12;E4
ACADECA;Who's the winner? Who's the reject?;S12;E4
ACADECA;How did she answer?;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;I realize that you've always been an outcast;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;It's not everyone at school who likes to think;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;To find a student that's like you;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;I've had one or maybe two;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;But the good ones disappear before I blink;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;Now, I understand you have your reservations (oh-wuh);S12;E4
Unleash the magic;It's hard to have a brain as large as yours (oh-oh-oh-oh);S12;E4
Unleash the magic;But if we don't win these games;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;Well, I think I've made it plain;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;What will happen if we have the losing scores!;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;Unleash the magic, unleash the magic;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;If we lose, then you're to blame (ah, ah-ah-ah);S12;E4
Unleash the magic;They all have used it, maybe abused it (ah-ah-ah);S12;E4
Unleash the magic;So then why can't we do the same?;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;Call it power, call it magic;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;If we lose, it will be tragic;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;More important is the knowledge we'll have lost (oh-oh-oh-oh);S12;E4
Unleash the magic;A chance like this won't come again;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;You'll regret not giving in;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;Isn't understanding magic worth the cost?;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;Unleash the magic, unleash the magic;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;We're not friends here after all;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;Our only interest in this business (ah-ah-ah);S12;E4
Unleash the magic;Is seeing Canterlot High School fall;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;What I'm suggesting's very simple;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;And since it's win-win on all scores;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;You only want to learn about the;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;Magic that you have stored;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;And as for me and all the others;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;We only want what we deserve;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;That our school will clinch the win;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;And my legacy will endure;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;Unleash the magic, unleash the magic;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;If we lose, then it's a crime;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;But we can win it if you begin it (ah-ah-ah);S12;E4
Unleash the magic;It's up to you to not fail this time;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;Unleash the magic, free the magic now;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;Unleash the magic, free the magic now;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;Imagine all I'll learn by setting it free;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;And now winning these games depends on me;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;And what doors might open if I try to use it;S12;E4
Unleash the magic;But the magic's what I really want to see;S12;E4
